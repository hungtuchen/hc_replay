1. Identify theta events
1. Identify SWR events
1. Investigate distance of place fields
1. Analyze replay events with behaviors (dependent on step 2)
1. Decoder on place cells for replay
1. Assign *score* for replay events
1. Simulation / Generative model: make fake replay events with Poisson generator
